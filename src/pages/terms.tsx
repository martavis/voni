				Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
			</h3>
			<p>
				Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to, or use of, the Website, the Products, or any purchase or otherwise related to this Agreement (&ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in Los Angeles, California, USA and shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of law provisions. If a Dispute arises under this Agreement, you agree to contact us at legal@voni.us (email). Before formally submitting a Dispute to arbitration, you and Voni Aesthetics may choose to informally resolve the Dispute. If any Dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree that any and all Disputes, other than those filed in small claims court, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in a location convenient to you or telephonically. Either you or Voni Aesthetics may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. Except as may be required by law as determined by the arbitrator, no party or arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. Voni Aesthetics will pay all of the filing costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of California: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or contesting the validity of Voni Aesthetics’ intellectual property rights and proprietary rights, including without limitation, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, or trade secrets; (ii) an action by a party for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief; (iii) any legal action by Voni Aesthetics against a non-consumer; or (iv) interactions with governmental and regulatory authorities. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration.
			</p>
			<p>
				The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
				<span className="font-bold"> 
					To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through a class action, private attorney general proceeding, class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span className="font-bold">
					YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION. 
				</span>
