            </p> 
            <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).
            </p> 
            <p>
                We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising and social media features.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Third-party platforms or social media networks. </span> If you choose to create an account through or connect the Service with another third-party platform, you may have the ability to limit the information that we may obtain from the third-party at the time you log in to the Service using the third-party’s authentication service or otherwise connect your account. You may also be able to control your settings through the third-party’s platform or service after you have connected your accounts.

                <span className="font-bold">What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies does Voni Aesthetics use on the Sites?</span>
            </p> 
            <p>
                On the Sites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies in the following categories described in the table below.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Advertising </span>. These cookies are used by advertising companies to collect information about how you use our Sites and other websites over time. These companies use this information to show you ads they believe will be relevant to you within our Service and elsewhere, and to measure how the ads perform.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Analytics </span>. These cookies help us understand how our Service is performing and being used. These cookies may work with web beacons included in emails we send to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Essential </span>. These cookies are necessary to allow the technical operation of our Service (e.g., they enable you to move around on a website and to use its features).
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Functionality/Performance </span>. Enhance the performance and functionality of our Sites.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Other technologies</span>
            </p> 
            <p>
                In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology and pixel tags to collect information automatically.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Web Beacons</span>
            </p> 
            <p>
                We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.
